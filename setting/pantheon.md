# The Gods

The gods are entities of such power that they have transended the material plane and reside in their own domains refered to as warrens. These domains outside the material plan are generally far smaller and are often made up of a discreet set of often simple components, though exceptions can be found.

The warrens while separate from the material plane have their basis in it, and their existance relies on that of the material plane in the dimentions it is composed, these dimentions linked to their counterparts on the material plane (for example, a warren of fire has as its basis the fires of the material plane). It is not known whether the warrens have always been, though it is clear that there have been successful attempts at creating new warrens, and thus attaining godhood, and many believe the gods of old were the original creators of the warrens they rule.

The primary route of divine ascendance, however, is to dethrone the current ruler of some existing warren, and those demi-god beings that come to be powerful enough to manage this are generally called "ascendents".

The rise of the ascendents seeking to take for themselves the domains of the gods of old, a shortcut in place of the work of building their own warrens, came to a head with the rifts and is now known as the war of the warrens, a way that plays out over and inbetween the world of the material plane, however more and more it finds its way in, causing mayhem and often taking the people of that plane as pawns in the games of the divine. The war of the old gods against the ascendents wages to this day, with but a handful of ascendents finding the paths to success and taking control of a warren, though those few warrens that were taken now form a conterposed force that rips a deeper hatred that even the most bitter rivalries of the old gods, and thus has found the old gods conflicts to be in many cases put aside and even overcome in leue of the rising of the ascendants. It should be noted that not all the ascendents seek to unseat old gods, and those that follow the old ways are welcomed by them.

## Ilmater
Ilmater is among the old gods who are collectively called "the old guard" of the warrens, who are thought to have generally built up their own warrens in ancient times where magic held far greater power than it does today. Among his virtues are endurance, martyrdom, perseverance, and suffering. He was the god of those who suffered, the oppressed, and the persecuted, who offered them relief and support, encouraged them to endure, and who encouraged others to help them, to take their burdens or take their places. He was called the Crying God, the Broken God, the Lord on the Rack, and the One Who Endures.

Ilmater's warren is the warren of his compassion, endurance, and suffering, and with its basis in the material realm it gains strength from the compassion of those who follow his path and from this strength comes to give his favored the endurance to carry on through any trial and so as well to bear the suffering of the world in its domain on the back of the crippled god himself, using the force of his warren to unburden those most destitute and pained.

## The Far Realm

The far realm is a realm that is outside both the material realm and the warrens, having no basis in the material realm at all. There was once a set of elder gods that came from this realm and ruled the world in brutal and strange tyrany in the earliest days of the world, times ancient beyond measure, and it was only upon the rise of the old gods that these alien gods were cast out and back to their realm, though some say the cults that worshipped these ancient evils still persist to this day, yearning for the time when they can once again feel the dark touch of those alien elderich gods of time before time.
