# The Allied Kingdoms

> This states rulers and people are according to them the rightful heirs to the old kingdom of Daegur, and given their political boundaries this claim is not disputed, though in truth holds little prestige outside the region, the legacy of the old empire long since plundered for all it could provide.

The southlands, officially the Allied Kingdoms, make up the midland and western areas of the continent, and are largely a temperate land, with the northernmost areas having trpics that ride the border to the west, and vast grasslands that span the way to the east above the Daegur Range.

The area also has come to almost universally and exclusively be refered to as the southlands. This is because it is not in fact a set of allied kingdoms but rather a single kingdom whos name upholds the farse that was the attempted unification of years past, where only one other kindom joined the association of what was then "New Daegur", establishing the "Allied Kingdoms" with the hope more would come to unite with them and take up position against the Salzarian Empire, their primary rival and the major power of the continent, with border disputes between them if not common, ever more common. Since then, the one small kingdom that made up the second has since cut ties and joined the Union of Coastal Republics. So the Allied Kingdoms were left with not but a single kingdom, and so to avoid the embarrasment of its failure the name it has unofficially taken up is now "The Southlands".

Being in the tradition of the old kingdom (Daegur, the great empire that reigned over the now southland territories and beyond before the season of fire and the ages that followed), the southland towns are largely human dominated and those non-human races that reside in the towns find little comfort there. The southland wilds are known to harbor a number of elven tribes, and the Daegur Range have dwarven settlements and strongholds, both make their way largely in isolation from the world of men.

Along side the elves in the southland wilds live a number of goblin tribes that, to the surprise of many, have found a peace between them that has existed as far back as the tribal lore goes, and only here is this kind of elven and goblin workings been observed. It is even said that they have been known to work together in raiding human settlements that seek to settle and cut bear the forests they inhabit.

The political authority of the southlands falls at the highest levels under the rule of “the high houses”, a set of 5 noble houses which make up what amounts to a partitioned royal aristocracy, where each house holds its power by a combination of dominance and tradition, with serious feuds between the high houses rare, and upstart houses quickly put in their place, resulting in a peace of sorts among the different centers of power that has been maintained for some time. They dictate policy and produce decrees by means of the Session of High Houses, a term to describe the simple meeting of the houses in sessions, following of course long and dry volumes of legal doctrine and precedent, where each high house appoints a team to represent their interests in whatever matter brought the high houses to a session. While holding the highest authority within the boundaries of the Southland territory, this body rarely actually meets, and the governance of the land is carried out across various different sectors of power across the noble stratum, much of which comes down to the towns and the local manors and houses that hold sway within them. This configuration of high houses carry the region in what some call a regional unity, and has been the standard from very early in the kingdoms some 200 year existance, back when the land was still known as "New Daegur". This unity however is for some a blatant lie, and it holds little justice, as those outside the nobled and landed few scrounge on the edges or live as outcasts in the mountains and the wilds, particularly rough are the lives of those of non-human descent, the rebuilding of the imagined new empire largely a project of human kind, as was the empire itself, with the nobility entirely made up of humans.
