# Church of Ilmater

## Organization

The formal church has the following structure, with the priesthood (the cloth) and the paladins (the guardians) managing themselves, save for the common rule of the Mortal Hand, neither Paladin nor Priest (though could have previously been either or neither). The priests and paladins get along fairly well, though tension exists and often they butt heads and can find it hard working together. When church wide matters are to be discussed, a gathering is called, where the Mortal Hand, Voice, Shield, and if necessary, high priests and arch paladins, come together to work things out.

## The Mortal Hand 
The Leader of the Church of Ilmater, and the only one to hold authority over both paladins and priests. Current bearer is Hasin Litorian of Warrenswal.

## Cloth of The Broken

The Cloth is the priesthood, lead by The Mortal Voice (Rilan Ilonsal). The priesthood is made up of clergy and the occational Cleric, though Clerics are generally of the Guardians rather than the Cloth.

## Guardians of The Broken

The Guardians make up the combatant forces that follow the path of Ilmater, an order of paladins and some with clerical training as well. The guardians have traditionally seen their role as one of upholding justice and waging war against those forces of evil that threaten the realm, though in recent decades they have come more and more to act as a local militia who take what pursuits they will, and with pretexts of protection and pursuit of evil, not all hold to the pretext and instead are little more than gangs of bullies.

## Daegur Fel Chapter

The Ilmater Church is Daegur Fel is headquartered in the North Ward at the Halls of Ilmater, and next door are located the Guardian Barracks.  The barracks contain generally between 20 and 30, and at any given time a few apprentices, while the priesthood in the halls holds upwards of 50 clergymen, with worship bringing in quite the pretty penny, as though it is not required to come to pray at the alter in the main hall, those who do not are shamed and looked down upon with disgust. The Daegur Fel order of paladins are among the more respected of the chapters and are considered to be generally working above board and serve the city for its benefit.

### High Priest
The High Priest of Daegur Fel is Alfistumaris Mordi, known as Mordi or Priest Mordi. For an old human man of slight build and a fragile disposition, he is quite the intimidating presence, if also comical at times, he is considered by many to be quite dismissive with little patience and when it comes to those he is responsible for falling short of his expectations, which are exceedingly high, and has for some an unbearably haughty attitude. Despite what comes off at first acquaintance, he nonetheless conceals a deep caring for those he considers himself responsible for, and holds himself to the highest standards.

### Arch Paladin
Ralin Fest, a tall round man with scruffy black beard and choppy hair, though with little attention to his appearance or figure, he is a master of the sword and disciplined in his duties where needed, though wispers can be heard of his backhanded dealings and extortion, expecially in the few shops that scatter the North Ward
