> Ithrons teacher and the high priest of the Daegur Fel priesthood.

While a man of his stature taking on an apprentice, let alone one preparing to become a paladin, who normally would be given to the Order of the Broken straight away, is near unheard of, he for reasons unknown took this paladin to be regardless and brought him to study under him at the hall of the priesthood, while maintaining the training provided by the best of the order in bringing those trainers to attend him at the hall. He seems to see something in Ithron that drives him to keep him close. Perhaps it is the distance that he recently made with his family and suspicion of the church, something the high priest has hinted at that he also sees and finds discontent over.

For an old human man of slight build and a fragile disposition, he is quite the intimidating presence, considered by many to be quite dismissive with little patience and when it comes to those he is responsible for falling short of his expectations, which are exceedingly high, and has for some an unbearably haughty attitude. Despite what comes off at first acquaintance, he nonetheless conceals a deep caring for those he considers himself responsible for, and holds himself to the highest standards.

While being among the priesthoods highest ranks, he has a very small circle of those who would consider him friend, and through his often confrontational and rebellious positions he has gained more than a few enemies among his order, an order which he sees as having fallen far from its once noble role in the world, and sees his purpose as one who would refashion the church according to the ways of their God once again.
