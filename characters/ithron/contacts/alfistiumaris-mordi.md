> Ithrons teacher and the high priest of the Daegur Fel priesthood.

While a man of his stature taking on an apprentice, let alone one preparing to become a paladin, who normally would be given to the Order of the Broken straight away, is near unheard of, he for reasons unknown took this paladin to be regardless and brought him to study under him at the hall of the priesthood, while maintaining the training provided by the best of the order in bringing those trainers to attend him at the hall. He seems to see something in Ithron that drives him to keep him close.

The high priest of the Daegur Fel branch, an old human man of slight build and a hauty disposition, considered by many to be quite dismissive with little patience and when it comes to those he is responsible for falling short of his expectations, which are exceedingly high, he nonetheless conceals a deep caring for those he comes to take under his tutilage and sees his method as the best way to prepare them for the path that lies before them, for the world out there is one of darkness and evil, be it paladin, cleric, or priest. All of this said, he nonetheless is a man of the highest order, and who holds himself to far higher standards that he has ever held his students and peers, and his harsh and often cruel approach underlays the hard understanding of the world and the short space between life and mistake that his students must take on at the most rigorous of pases so as best to avoid that one mistake that can end lives, or worse.
