# Ithron Zhertva

> Aasimar - Paladin 1

Born into a high ranking noble religious family, he is the eldest of 6 brothers. Ithron’s family has a special place in the realm and the church, family lore holds that Ithron’s ancestors were sent by Ilmater himself to help those who were suffering find solace and peace in the madness of the world during the "Great Rot", more outlandish rumors say that the blood of the crippled God runs directly through their veins. The family has been corrupted over many generations by their power, lineage, greed, and their natural abilities. The family and church have always thought there was something off about Ithron he always had a little more charisma then most and has always connected with the higher purpose of the church and less with the financial and power aspects of the religion. The family has used Itrhon for his strength and charisma for years policing his local district making friends, protecting Aasimar businesses and catching and punishing the occasional thief. Ithron was content in his lifestyle until he has learned that his family serves Ilmater in name only. Ithron learned that the family has been extorting the poor and discovered rumors of far more serious corruption and murder which caused a divide between him and his family. The family doesn’t see value in helping those who do not help themselves and the family and church in general hold a great disdain for the dirty races who have flocked to the city for generations and caused its “demise”. Ithron is down on his family and looking for greater purpose and wonders if the religion he has dedicated his life to is wrong or if it’s just been corrupted.

### Order of the Broken

The Order of the Broken is the fellowship of Paladins that make up the faction within the broader Ilmater Church, which is most common in the minds of those in those most destitute of the towns and the poorest and most pained farmers and peasants. In Daegur Fel, the halls of the church are found in the center of the North Ward, the poorest part of the city, a sprawling slums. While these halls proclaim their role is in servicing the poor, their discreet connections to various criminal organizations and the seeming abundance of wealth make some question their place in the city.
