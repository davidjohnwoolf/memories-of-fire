# Terel Wornshade

> A mentor and friend who, upon finding a hand in his pocket, found himself obliged to show the then clumsy Iggdrasil how it was done.

An elven man slight of build and a pair of shifty slim gray eyes, whos face begets a man worn past his years, though a handsome man nonetheless who takes this further with maintaining a well groomed and fashionable appearance, his graying brown hair always pulled back in a short tight ponytail and dawning a clean short beard of gray with little brown left in it, his eyes a dark gray as if to compliment the hair, and his skin dark to match his clothes which without exception seem to come in 
black, demonstrating a preparedness in his position, the exception to the black is the occasional cloak bearing silver linings, one he wears to special occasions only.

While he has come from harship and has known little else outside the comradery he found among the guild, ruthless though they could sometimes be, the hardships of his life have not torn from him a quick witted humor and the ability to make light of even the worst of times, making one think nothing in the world could phase him, as he never loses the sly and at east confidence that tells of a man who has seen it all and come through the better for it.
