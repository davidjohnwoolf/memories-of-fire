# Draeeth Melkor

> Wood Elf - Rogue 1

The elf then named Iggdrasil MÃ¡hanaxar was born into a forest in the north, one of the few that grew between the rifts. For 90 years he become accustomed to those woods when one day the nearby rift cataclysmically grew and engulfed the forest in flame and death. The elder elves blamed the younger generations for failing to sacrifice to the god of the rift, but perhaps something more sinister was at work. The few remaining elves were forced to flee to the southwest as refugees. Many went to Daegur Fel to find food and work, while some went searching for new forests. Those that came to Daegur Fel, such as Iggdrasil, after a failed decade of finding a new forest home, found no penance or solace; they found violence and poverty inflicted by citizens afraid of "bringers of the rifts". This cruelty forced many refugees to engage in violence and thievery. On a pickpocket spree, Iggdrasil keenly pickpocketed a ranking member of the thieves guild, [Terel Wornshade](./contacts/terel-wornshade.md), who took an interest in the elven thief, naming him Draeeth Melkor, and initiated him as a new member to perfect his skills of deceit and thievery.

### Theives Guild

The thieves guild is a part of a set of various criminal networks from assassins to magic item markets and others, making up those specialists in the art of taking property from the nobility and the landed lords and giving to the ladies of the night and the ale houses in riotous nights of drunken mischief and vulgarity of all kinds.

In the city of Daegur Fel the thieves guild is particularly influential and is known to maintain ultimate control over the rooftops and dark paths through the city at night, a position normally held by the assassins, with the thieves in other places giving way to the assassins, even to the detriment of their own missions, where as in the city of Daegur Fel, the assassins instead make way for the thieves of the guild.
