### Theives Guild

The theives guild is a part of a set of various criminal networks from assasins to magic item trades and others, making up those specialists in the art of taking property from the nobility and the landed lords and giving to the ladies of the night and the ale houses in riotous nights of drunken mischief and vulgarity of all kinds.

In the city of Daegur Fel the theives guild is particularly influencial and is known to maintain ultimate control over the rooftops and dark paths through the city at night, a position normally held by the assasins, with the theives parting for them, but here the assasins instead make way for the rooftop travelling and wall scaling theives of the guild.
