### Elisethrin Rangers

The Elisethrin rangers are a conclave of rangers that are found spread across much of the realm, with the most elite of their numbers taking up territories in the rift borderlands, that walk in the tradition that was left by the great ranger of old, the elf Elisethrin, as she built her name and following and enscribed her legacy into the world through mediation of the peoples of the towns and those of the land and the wilds, teaching peace where others sought war.

They see as their role in the realm the mediation of the societies of the civilized peoples with that of the rest of nature. A tenet of their tradition is to understand nature as a totality, and to see their own place and even that of civilization as not separate but as a specific segment of nature, and as such unlike many druidic traditions they see their position in the mediation of the towns and those products of civil society with the forests and the land as one of the resolution of conflict, and not of a struggle between nature and some "unnatural" force.

Unlike other conclaves of rangers, Elisethrin taught a way that broke with the common specialization against certain species, claiming there was a trap that hid in the labeling of any species as an eternal enemy, and instead taught the ranger to see the truth in of any species as foe or ally upon seeing into their own personal nature, and in this discernment reveal foe from ally and their weakness and strengths as such.
