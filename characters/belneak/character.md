### Elisethrin Rangers

The Elisethrin rangers are rangers that are in the broader tradition that was left by the great ranger of old, the elf Elisethrin, whos ways followed the truth she revealed in the land and the water and the sky, where in seeking this truth in the wilds one could come to transend the blinded world created by man in seeing himself as above the natural world, and so come to walk a path among the world and not in a false separation from it, and in this way see the truth of the world and thus walk the path of a true ranger.

While inspired by druidic religions, and friend of many great druids of Sylvan lore, Elisethrin rejected their ways as the ways of a zealot and rejected what she saw as the same image of the natural world held by the men of the towns, only flipped on its head, that held it apart from mans ways and the ways of iron and machine, where she instead saw these things as simply another dimention of the natural world, and to truly find the truth of the world one had to see outselves as being a part of the wild world and not something alien or separate from it, to see everything in this life as connected and to understand and illuminate those connections with our knowledge of them. Those in this tradition are said to attain an ability to see truth in all things.

The rangers in this tradition are not held to any rigorous code and in the end only form a loose network of like minded travelers of the wilds, however an informal expectation of those who seek to take her wisdom to its end will organize together and take up territories over the lands and in those territories facilitate the interrelation of man and wild over that land where they can when they can, often becoming guides and teachers.
