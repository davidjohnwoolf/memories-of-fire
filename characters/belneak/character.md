### Elisethrin Rangers

The Elisethrin rangers are a conclave of rangers that are found spread across much of the realm, with the most elite of their numbers taking up territories in the rift borderlands, that walk in the tradition that was left by the great ranger of old, the elf Elisethrin, as she built her name and following and inscribed her legacy into the world through the mediation of the peoples of the towns and those of the land and the wilds, teaching peace where others sought war.

Unlike other conclaves of rangers, Elisethrin taught a way that broke with the common specialization against certain species, claiming there was a trap that hid in the labeling of any species as an eternal enemy, and instead taught the ranger to see the truth in of any species as foe or ally upon seeing into the eyes of any creature, and in this discernment reveal foe from ally and their weakness and strengths as such.
