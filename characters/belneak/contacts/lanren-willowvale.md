# Lanren Willowvale

> A friend and fellow ranger in the tradition of Elisethrin.

Fellow warden in the southlands, ranging in the southland wilds on the eastern side and whos territory overlaps with Belneak.

Lanren for a number of years ranged over large areas of the Kelimanian Plains in the north, and knows much of those lands.

A tall slender elf with dark gray eyes framed in a strongly lined face, whos black hair falls into a loose tie beflow flowing down his back. Clothed in leathers he has a sword on either side and a longbow on his back while among the woods.

His serious demeaner betrays a good spirited man with little bitterness for any but those who would harm the lands, though he prefers the woods to the company of others and can come across as standoffish and uninterested to those who don't know him, particularly to those outside the circle of rangers he calls friends. Even among them he talks little and shares even less of his life.
