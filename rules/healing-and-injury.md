# Healing and Injury

Taking on a more "gritty" approach than the standard mechanisms, healing here takes longer and wounds carry the risk of injury.

In the case of healing naturally, a full rest only provides healing equal to a hit dice (1 hit dice per day max) + constitution modifier. A short rest regains 1 hit point, and also can be applied only once a day. So, a character can only regain hit points equal to a roll of their hit dice, their con mod, and 1 more from a short rest.

When a character has taken over half their hit points in damage, they as a result must make a constitution save (DC 10 normally and 15 if they also fell to zero), or incur an "injury", where the character takes upon themselves 1 hit die of temporary hit points lost for a period of days equal to 10 - their constitution modifier (minimum 3). Outside of the normal healing the character can attempt magical repair, and upon moving from full health beyond their temporary limit, to reach their normal limit, 5 points of magical healing must be spent for each 1 point of injured hit points regained. A character with an injury also suffers from disadvantage on all dexterity and strength based checks (including attack rolls).

The occurrence of a natural 1 on the con save puts the character out of function for the period of healing, unable to walk, and also as a sever injury doubles the healing time as well as the magic healing points required to heal.

Magical healing works as normal beyond the described cases.
