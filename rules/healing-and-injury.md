# Healing and Injury

Beyond the standard mechanisms of healing, and in cases overriding them, the following rules are to be followed when considering healing and injury from loss of hit points.

## Damage

Hit points reduced from normal damage sustained during battle.

Long Rest - 1 hit die + constitution modifier (minimum 3)

Short Rest - constitution modifier (minimum 1)

## Injury

Failed constitution saving throw (DC 10) after being reduced to 0 hit points.

An injury incurs injury points, which stand against the maximum hit points, lowering the maximum by the injury point total.

Injury points sustained - 1 hit die

To heal injury points, a character must refrain from strenuous activity during the day of rest, else no change is made to injury points.

The temporary hit point reductions are beside the standard healing, so that healing works as normal, with the injury point reductions simply altering the maximum, and not the actual hit points (so that in the case of hit points that are lower than the maximum and are not regained during the standard rest healing, the injury points do not necessarily translate to hit points regained).

Day of Rest - injury points reduction equal to constitution modifier (minimum 1).

Magical Healing - injury points can be healed with magical healing, where 3 points of standard healing are required to heal 1 injury point.

### Major Injury

Results from a critical fail on a constitution saving throw after being reduced to 0 hit points.

Injury points sustained - 2 hit die (maximum 2/3 total, minimum 5 or 1/3 total)

Disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks until fully healed.

Movement speed reduced by half, unable to run.

A DC 10 constitution infection save must be made (successful assistance provided by healers kit gives advantage).

## Infection

During an infection the subject is no longer able to heal from rest.

An infection is sustained from a failed infection save or upon a critical fail in the attempted use of a healers kit to stabilize someone.

Characters that have resistance to disease or poisoning have advantage on all infection saves.

Magical healing assumes injury cost for all HP gains, and cannot bring the character out of infection.

The subject must perform a constitution save DC 10 each day following the onset of the infection. A successful assistance with healing kit gives advantage. Succeeding this save brings them out of infection.

If the character falls below 0 hit points under infection, the next failed infection save ends their life.

Upon failing the infection save 3 days in a row, the subject falls into severe infection.

### Serious Infection

Under a severe infection, subject falls into fever state and becomes confused and unable to move about without assistance.

In the severe infection magical healing becomes 10 to 1, and the character must make a constitution save of 15 every hour or sustain 1 hit die - constitution modifier additional damage (minimum 1).

Under serious infection, a successful save takes them back to a standard infection, where another save must be made to fully recover.

## Magical Cures

Magical assistance can both heal injuries and bring the character out of infection in ways normal magical healing cannot.

Spells that would normally cure sickness or disease can be made to bring a subject out of infection upon a spell save of 10 for standard infection or 15 for severe infection.

Spells that are made to fix what is broken or disabled can sometimes also be used to cure an injury upon the successful spell save 10 (minor) and 15 (major), discuss with DM what spells may apply here.
