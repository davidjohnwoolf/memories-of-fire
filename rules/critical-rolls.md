# Critical Roles

A critical role is a roll that naturally lands on either 1 or 20 when rolling the d20.

A natural 20 is an automatic success, and a natural 1 an automatic failure, regardless of any modifications that would have otherwise applied.

During an attack, a natural 20 is a critical hit and as a result, the total damage (dice and modifiers) is doubled. A natural 1, on the other hand, is a critical miss, and will provoke an attack of opportunity upon the roller from any opponent within reach.
