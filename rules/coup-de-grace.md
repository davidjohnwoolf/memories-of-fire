# Coup De Grace

A Coup De Grace is a case where the target of a characters attack is prone or unable to move, with a part of the body freely available for the other character to attack, the attacker having a weapon of a type capable of dealing a death blow and the time to make it happen (3 full rounds available to them at least) they can instead of attack perform a coup de grace, which is an automatic kill, with exemptions for cases of special or magical defense. The attacker may choose to either kill outright or take down to zero hit points, and attempt to stabilize them.
