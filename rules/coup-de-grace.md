# Coup De Grace

A Coup De Grace is a case where the target of a characters attack is prone or unable to move, with a part of the body freely available for the other character to attack, the attacker having a weapon of a type capable of dealing a death blow and the time to make it happen (3 full rounds available to them at least) they can instead of attack perform a coup de grace, which is an automatic kill (or in the case of special defenses of the character, a blow that takes them down to zero HP).
