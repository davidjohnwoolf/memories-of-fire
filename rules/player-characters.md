# Player Characters

Outside a players primary character, there exist the following options:

## Secondary Characters

The players may take on a secondary character if desired upon discussion with the DM and a suitable role for them. The players must have a primary character that has reached level 3 or higher to take on a second.

This character is not one that should regularly join the party, but rather as a secondary character play a smaller part and only join the party on rare and special occurrences or when the primary character is not in the party.

The secondary character will be of less capability by a significant margin to the average party level, in general 3 levels below, and will play a minor role, not a standard party member, but rather as a follower working behind the scenes, a party ally in a given locality, a scout that prepares the way in certain ways for the parties arrival, etc.

See the DM to discuss secondary characters that are outside this general criteria, such as an enemy secondary character.

The secondary character can take the place of the primary character upon discussion, and the option of that characters rising to average party level may be available.

## Character Death

Character death incurs the loss of 1 level if creating a new character, however cannot extend a characters levels lost if already behind (a new character creation will never be more than 1 less than the average parties level).

A character that has spanned 5+ levels (level 1-10) or 3+ levels (level 10-20) without death is exempt from the controlling players losing a level upon new character creation / character death.

If seeking to create a new primary character outside circumstances of death, see the DM. This may be an option without incurring loss of level.
